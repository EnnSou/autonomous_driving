# SSD: Single Shot Multibox Detector

The SSD approach is based on a feed-forward convolutional network for detecting object in images. It discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. The network produces a fixed-size collection of bounding boxes and scores for the presence of object class instances in those boxes, followed by a non-maximum suppression step to produce the final detections.
